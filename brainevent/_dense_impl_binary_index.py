def binary_vec_dot_dense_mat(binary_index, weights):
    """
    Computes the dot product between a binary vector (in sparse format) and a dense matrix.

    The binary vector is represented by `binary_arr`, which contains the spike values,
    their indices, and the count of spikes. The dense matrix is given by `weights`.
    The function multiplies the selected rows of the dense matrix (as indicated by the
    spike indices) and sums them, then applies the unit scaling.

    Parameters
    ----------
    binary_index : BinaryArrayIndex
        An object representing a binary vector in sparse format. It must have the attributes:
        - value: the spike values (typically all ones for binary)
        - spike_indices: indices of nonzero (spike) elements
        - spike_count: number of spikes (nonzero elements)
    weights : ndarray or compatible
        A dense matrix of shape (N, M), where N is the number of possible indices and M is the output dimension.
        Maybe a unit-aware array.

    Returns
    -------
    result : ndarray or compatible
        The result of the dot product, with the same dtype and unit as the input weights.

    Notes
    -----
    This function supports custom CPU and GPU kernels for efficient computation.
    The binary vector is assumed to be sparse, and only the rows of the dense matrix
    corresponding to the spike indices are summed.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Suppose binary_arr has spike_indices = [0, 2], spike_count = 2
    >>> # and weights is a (3, 4) matrix
    >>> result = binary_vec_dot_dense_mat(binary_index, weights)
